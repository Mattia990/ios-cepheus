# Handoff: iOS on Xiaomi Mi 9 (cepheus)

Last updated **2026-11-09** (newest work first under "Start here"). Read this first, then [NOTES.md](NOTES.md)
(hardware facts, test loop, bootloader rules).

## Start here (next session)

### SE17 FIFO is disabled in hardware; touch moved to bit-banged I2C (2026-11-09)

**Phone run `touch-on1` (kernel built from the GENI stack).** SpringBoard booted with the
touch-enabled kernel; touch stayed dead and the log stopped at SE17's FIFO-disable check:

```
[  74.630] SWEET FTS: se17 fw=0x303 proto=3 status=0 tx=0x20102964 rx=0x20104900 ios=0x3 qup=0x10030000 depth=16/16
[  74.630] SWEET FTS: need ABL-loaded I2C firmware and 32-bit FIFOs; stopping
```

All other SE registers were valid. TWRP's debug log
(`/sys/kernel/debug/ipc_logging/i2c-2/log`) says `i2c in GSI ONLY mode`: on cepheus
`GENI_IF_FIFO_DISABLE_RO` (0x64) reads 0x64 and the QUP runs I2C through GPI DMA, not the
legacy FIFO. Porting GSI rings, DMA descriptors and IOMMU/firmware work to XNU for one slow
bus is not practical, so the FIFO path is abandoned. The GENI driver never reached the
chip: the FIFO check stops before the first transfer.

**Decision: bit-bang the same two pins.** `0085` keeps the FTS power/reset code and
replaces the transport with a software I2C master on GPIO 55/56 (qup17, south TLMM at
0x03d00000); the command/event layer follows Xiaomi's cepheus `fts_521` driver (`0x86`
event read, `0xa0/00/01` sense-on, `0xa6/00/00` system info, event `0x03`
controller-ready), not mainline `stmfts`. Details:

- `cepheustouch=1` starts after `cepheustouchdelay` seconds; `cepheustouchlog=1` logs every event.
- 19.2 MHz `mach_absolute_time` ticks, 4 us setup, 2 us low / 3 us high (~150-200 kHz),
  START/repeated START/STOP, ACK/NACK, SCL clock stretching (10 ms) and 9-clock recovery.
- Probes SDA=55/SCL=56 first, then the swapped pair; a wrong order only NACKs and a reset
  between attempts leaves the chip in a known state.
- Reset GPIO 12 is **active low** (Xiaomi's cepheus driver drives it low for 10 ms, then
  high; the live DT's flag 0 is not a polarity). Reset and IRQ 122 use the DT active state:
  function gpio, pull-up, 8 mA. SDA/SCL use the qup17 sleep state: pull-up, 2 mA.
- VDDIO is GPIO 84 (`touch_vddio_vreg`, active high, 4 ms), AVDD is `ldoc1` at 1.8 V.
- IRQ is polled: read the event stack when GPIO 122 is low, plus once every 10 ms; after
  10 consecutive read errors the bus is recovered and a release is sent for held fingers.

**Patch stack.** `0085` was regenerated with the 774-line `bsd/dev/sweet_fts.c` (blob
`8954729db921f60ff4476884435887bc2a5dad9f`); the obsolete `sweet_fts.c` GCC-halt hunk was
removed from `0086`. Host `clang -fsyntax-only` (kernel stubs, `-Wall -Wextra`) and
`tools/validate-repo.py` pass. No kernel has been built from this stack yet.

**Next boot (user builds the kernel).** Use the exact `touch-on1` command line:

```
debug=0xc serial=3 cpus=8 keepsyms=1 -enable_kprintf_spam -noprogress rd=ufsroot0 \
ufsrw=1 rootrw=1 unentitled_ios_sim_launch=1 ignition_level=1 wdt_test=no_user_checkin \
launchd_unsecure_cache=1 wdt=-1 sweetfb_noconsole=1 sweetfb_hz=60 ufslogsecs=2 \
cepheusreboot=300 cepheuswdt=0 cepheustouch=1 cepheustouchdelay=30 cepheustouchlog=1
```

Expect `SWEET FTS: ready try 1 sda=55 scl=56 idle=1/1 err=0` (the controller-ready event
`0x03` proves address and ACK), `bus sda=55 scl=56`, then
`sysinfo fw=0060 chip0=... chip1=...` and `sense on err=0; polling every 5 ms`, then
`enter`/`motion`/`leave` events. If `sig` is not `a5/01`, check the `0xa6/00/00`
framebuffer command/address order and the SDA/SCL order; the ready event already proves
the address. If events appear but coordinates are wrong, compare the logged raw 8-byte
events with `event[1]` (id/type) and x/y in `event[2..4]`.

**Open.** No kernel has been built from this stack, so neither the bit-banged transport
nor the `fts_521` protocol has run on the phone. If the chip never ACKs, check the idle
levels printed before START (`idle=1/1`), the SDA/SCL order, and whether GPIO 84 really
powers `touch_vddio_vreg`. After touch works, restore `wdt_arm(30)` in `shim/shim.c` and
drop `cepheuswdt=0`.

### Superseded: GENI I2C driver (2026-11-09)

The earlier 666-line GENI driver (SE17 at 0xc80000, wrapper 0xcc0000) is kept in patch
history only. Its SE register reads were valid, but `touch-on1` shows the FIFO interface
is hardware-disabled; the wrapper/FIFO-depth work is moot for the current transport.

### Hardware read from live phone (DONE 2026-11-05)

Read from the Xiaomi Mi 9 (cepheus) via adb (root). All key hardware facts are now in NOTES.md:

- **Display**: Samsung EA8076 FHD CMD, 1080x2340 @60 Hz, command mode
- **Splash FB**: cont_splash_region 0x9c000000/0x2400000; the VIG0 source register says the panel scans out 0x9c000000 itself (flame's FB is at 0x9c400000 — copying that number shifted the UI down 4 MB)
- **Touch**: ST FTS on I2C 0xc80000, addr 0x49, IRQ 122, x=1080 y=2340
- **Memory**: banks 0x80000000/0x3cc00000, 0xc0000000/0x80000000, 0x1_4000_0000/0xc0000000 (~6 GB)
- **Most SoC addresses identical to flame** (GIC, PMIC, USB, UFS, WDT, MDP, GPU)
- **Keys**: GPIO keys (vol_up code 115, ai_key code 689) — needs GPIO keys driver

### 1. Update remaining TBD values in code

Files still needing cepheus-specific addresses:
- `xnu/patches/0083-cepheus-display-keys-watchdog.patch` — WDT address confirmed (0x17c10000), but
  keys and touch drivers need rework (GPIO keys vs PMIC keys, I2C touch vs SPI touch)
- `xnu/patches/0085-cepheus-fts-touch.patch` — complete rewrite needed for I2C ST FTS at 0xc80000
- `xnu/patches/0088-cepheus-usb.patch` — USB PHY addresses confirmed same as flame
- `shim/sde.c` — panel comment updated (Samsung EA8076), register offsets same as flame

### 2. Build first test kernel and shim

```sh
python3 tools/mkadt.py work/boot/cepheus-hi.adt
tools/build-xnu.sh work/build-0083.log
cp work/dxb/build/xnu.obj/DEVELOPMENT_ARM64_SWEET/kernel.development.sweet work/boot/kernel-0083
# build shim + payload + boot image
# fastboot boot work/boot/shim-boot-0083.img
```

### 3. Boot and read logs from TWRP

```sh
fastboot boot downloads/twrp/twrp-...-cepheus.img
tools/cepheus-log-pull.sh shim logs/boot-0083.txt
tools/cepheus-log-pull.sh xnu logs/boot-0083-xnu.bin
```

## Where things stand

**Initial skeleton created.** Project structure copied from ios-flame with all flame→cepheus renames.
Hardware facts confirmed from live FDT. Most SoC addresses are identical to flame (same SM8150).
Key remaining work: touch driver (I2C not SPI), keys driver (GPIO not PMIC), and verifying
Xiaomi ABL boot image rules.

## Milestones (to be filled in as work progresses)
